- **Cost and Performance**: Optimize builds with caching, right-sizing resources, and efficient triggers.

## Practice Questions

### Q1. Cloud Build & Secret Rotation
Your application runs on Cloud Run and requires a password rotated every 24 hours with zero downtime. Whatâ€™s the best deployment strategy?  
A. Use Cloud Build to bake the password into the container  
B. Store the rotated password in Secret Manager and mount it as a volume  
C. Use Secret Manager and refresh the secret via environment variables  
D. Hard-code the password and rebuild daily  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**  
ðŸ‘‰ Mounting secrets as volumes from Secret Manager ensures zero downtime and automatic refresh. (env variables will expose secrets in logs)

### Q2. Attestation for Supply Chain Security
Your organization demands verifiable build provenance so production deployment only uses authorized builds. What should you implement?  
A. Artifact Registry alone  
B. Cloud Build with Binary Authorization and attestations  
C. Local builds and manual approval  
D. Cloud Deploy without provenance checks  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**  
ðŸ‘‰ Binary Authorization with attestations ensures only trusted, verifiable builds are deployed.

### Q3. Caching Docker Builds
Your team complains about slow Docker builds in Cloud Build. What change best speeds up builds?  
A. Add --cache-from referencing Artifact Registry and optimize Dockerfile layering (less modified files early)  
B. Use Cloud Storage as cache and place frequently modified files early  
C. Always use latest tags; rely on default Dockerfile  
D. Remove multi-stage builds for simplicity  
âœ… **Correct Answer: A**  
ðŸ‘‰ --cache-from plus optimized Dockerfile layering allows efficient reuse of cached layers.

B. Push to Artifact Registry and use Cloud Build to replicate to AWS securely  
C. Manually download and upload during deploy  
D. Store in Cloud Storage and manually transfer  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**  
ðŸ‘‰ Artifact Registry supports multi-cloud artifact sharing and grants secure access via IAM.

### Q5. CI Trigger Management at Scale
Your enterprise has dozens of microservices in separate repos. You need a scalable CI solution in GCP. Whatâ€™s best?  
A. Manually create Cloud Build triggers per repo

### Q6. Workload Identity for Builds
Your Cloud Build needs to push images to Artifact Registry with least-privilege access. Which approach is best?  
A. Provide Owner role on project  
B. Use default service account with broad permissions  
C. Use Workload Identity to grant minimal push permissions  
D. Embed credentials in build config  
âœ… **Correct Answer: C**  
ðŸ‘‰ Workload Identity avoids key management and enforces least privilege practices.

### Q7. Build in Private VPC
Your build needs access to internal resources through a private VPC (no public internet). How do you configure this?  
A. Build on public Cloud Build pool  
B. Use private Cloud Build worker pools within your VPC  
C. Use Jenkins on VM  
D. Expose internal resources publicly temporarily  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**  
ðŸ‘‰ Private worker pools inside your VPC enable build access while maintaining network isolation.

Youâ€™re configuring a secure multi-stage deployment (dev â†’ staging â†’ prod). What resource defines this path?  
A. Cloud Build trigger  
B. Cloud Deploy delivery pipeline  
C. Artifact Registry tag policy  
D. Kubernetes deployment YAML  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**

### Q9. Releasing with Skaffold
How does Cloud Deploy use Skaffold in a delivery pipeline?  
A. Skaffold builds the container images only  
B. Skaffold defines rendering and deployment logic  
C. Skaffold manages approval gates  
D. Skaffold is not supported  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**

### Q10. Manual Approval Gate
Your production deployment policy requires human approval before rollout. Which feature supports that?  
A. IAM admin only  
B. Cloud Build approvals  
C. Cloud Deploy approvals  
D. Skaffold profile  
âœ… **Correct Answer: C**  
ðŸ‘‰ Cloud Deploy allows configuration of approval gates before promotion to production.

A rollout fails in staging. What can Cloud Deploy do to recover?  
A. Delete the release  
B. Wait and retry deployment with same release  
C. Initiate rollback to previously successful rollout  
D. Abort pipeline; no recovery possible  
âœ… **Correct Answer: C**  
ðŸ‘‰ Cloud Deploy supports retry or rollback to previous successful release.

### Q12. Traceable Build Provenance
