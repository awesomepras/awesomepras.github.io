## Key Points
- **Cloud Build**: Automates CI with triggers, buildpacks, and caching (--cache-from, GCS). Supports hybrid/multi-cloud via worker pools and APIs.
- **Cloud Deploy**: Manages CD with delivery pipelines, targets (e.g., GKE, Cloud Run), and Skaffold for manifest rendering. Supports canary, blue/green, and approvals.
- **Artifact Registry**: Central repository for container images and packages, integrated with Cloud Build and Cloud Deploy.
- **Build Optimization**: Use caching, optimized Docker layering, and appropriate machine types to improve performance and reduce costs.
- **Scalability**: Use IaC (Terraform/Deployment Manager) for consistent pipeline definitions across many repositories.

## Practice Questions

### Q1. Multi-Environment Rollout
You want to promote builds from staging â†’ pre-prod â†’ prod with approvals. Which Cloud Deploy feature should you use?  
A. Cloud Build triggers  
B. A delivery pipeline with targets for each environment  
C. Cloud Scheduler  
D. Manual kubectl apply  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**  
ðŸ‘‰ Cloud Deploy uses delivery pipelines with multiple targets representing environments. Approvals can be enforced between stages.

### Q2. Canary Rollout
You want 10% traffic â†’ new version, monitor for 1h, then 100% rollout if healthy. How do you configure this in Cloud Deploy?  
A. Set up manual kubectl rollouts  
B. Define a canary deployment strategy in Cloud Deploy  
C. Use Cloud Functions for rollout control  
D. Split services across namespaces  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**  
ðŸ‘‰ Cloud Deploy supports canary and progressive delivery strategies natively. Canary allows partial rollout + monitoring before full promotion.

### Q3. Automatic Load Testing in CI/CD
You are configuring your CI/CD pipeline natively on Google Cloud. You want builds in a pre-production GKE environment to be automatically load-tested before being promoted to production. You need to ensure that only builds that have passed this test are deployed to production. You want to follow Google-recommended practices.  
A. Create an attestation for the builds that pass the load test by requiring the lead QA engineer to sign using a personal key  
B. Create an attestation for the builds that pass the load test by using a private key stored in Cloud KMS authenticated through Workload Identity  
C. Create an attestation using a service account JSON key stored as a Kubernetes Secret  
D. Require a manual KMS signature from the QA lead  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**
