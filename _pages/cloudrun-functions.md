## Key Points
- **Cloud Run Services**: Handle request-driven workloads with traffic splitting and tagged revisions for gradual rollouts and testing.
- **Cloud Run Jobs**: Designed for batch or one-off tasks (e.g., ETL, data processing) without HTTP endpoints.
- **Worker Pools**: Run background tasks in isolated environments without autoscaling, ideal for secure or hybrid setups.
- **Cloud Functions**: Event-driven, lightweight functions triggered by Pub/Sub, HTTP, or other events.
- **IAM and Deployment**: Use roles like run.invoker and run.admin for execution and management; tags provide stable URLs for revisions.

## Practice Questions

### Q1. Cloud Run vs Cloud Functions
What is the key difference between Cloud Run and Cloud Functions?  
A. Cloud Run only supports Python, while Cloud Functions supports any language  
B. Cloud Functions is event-driven, while Cloud Run runs containerized applications  
C. Cloud Run automatically retries failed functions, while Cloud Functions does not  
D. Cloud Run requires Kubernetes, while Cloud Functions does not  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**  
ðŸ‘‰ Cloud Functions is event-driven (responds to triggers like Pub/Sub, HTTP, etc.), while Cloud Run runs full containers you deploy.

### Q2. Traffic Splitting
Your company has a Cloud Run service running v1 (stable). A new release v2 needs to be tested gradually. You want 20% of traffic to go to v2 while 80% remains on v1. What is the best approach?  
A. Deploy v2 as a new service with its own URL  
B. Deploy v2 as a new revision of the existing service and configure traffic splitting to send 20% of requests to v2  
C. Replace v1 with v2 and roll back if issues occur  
D. Use Cloud Load Balancing to distribute traffic manually  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**  
ðŸ‘‰ Cloud Run supports built-in traffic splitting between revisions. Deploying v2 as a revision of the same service and splitting traffic ensures gradual rollout with rollback capability.

### Q3. Tagged Revisions
You want to create a URL that points only to a specific revision of a Cloud Run service, regardless of traffic splitting. What should you do?  
A. Use the serviceâ€™s default URL  
B. Tag the revision, which creates a dedicated URL for it  
C. Deploy it to a separate project  
D. Use Cloud DNS to alias the revision  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**  
ðŸ‘‰ Cloud Run tags provide dedicated, stable URLs for revisions. Useful for testing or internal users without affecting production traffic.

### Q4. Jobs vs Services
When should you use a Cloud Run Job instead of a Service?  
A. For long-running HTTP servers  
B. For batch or data processing tasks that donâ€™t require HTTP requests  
C. For WebSocket-based apps  
D. For apps that need to scale to zero  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**  
ðŸ‘‰ Cloud Run Jobs are for batch workloads (ETL, cron-triggered jobs, data cleanup), while Services are for request/response workloads.

### Q5. Zero-Downtime Deployment
Which Cloud Run feature allows zero-downtime deployment of new versions?  
A. Blue-green deployments  
B. Traffic splitting  
C. Horizontal Pod Autoscaling  
D. Service Mesh  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**  
ðŸ‘‰ Cloud Run supports traffic splitting natively, enabling progressive rollouts by routing % of traffic to new revisions.

### Q6. Cloud Run Jobs Purpose
What are Cloud Run Jobs used for?  
A. Long-running microservices  
B. Stateless, request-based workloads  
C. Batch or data processing tasks  
D. Stateful streaming applications  
âœ… **Correct Answer: C**  
ðŸ‘‰ Jobs in Cloud Run are designed for one-off or batch workloads (ETL, ML batch inference, migrations).

### Q7. Deploying a New Revision
You deploy a new revision of a Cloud Run service but want only 10% of traffic to go to it while keeping 90% on the stable revision. How do you configure this?  
A. Use gcloud run services update-traffic with --to-latest=10 and --to-revisions for the stable revision  
B. Deploy the revision with --traffic 10 directly in the deploy command  
C. Manually edit the YAML file to set traffic split and redeploy  
D. All of the above are possible  
âœ… **Correct Answer: D**  
ðŸ‘‰ Cloud Run supports traffic splitting via deploy command, update-traffic, or editing the YAML. For the exam, know both CLI and declarative methods.

### Q8. Pinning Clients to a Revision
You want QA testers to access only the new revision of your Cloud Run service, without affecting production users. What should you do?  
A. Configure a traffic split with 0% to new revision, then give testers the direct revision URL  
B. Create a tag for the new revision and share the tag-based URL with testers  
C. Add testers to a special IAM policy that routes them to the new revision  
D. Deploy a separate Cloud Run service for QA  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**  
ðŸ‘‰ Tags give custom URLs (like tag---service-xyz.a.run.app) that always point to that revision. This is the recommended approach for QA/blue-green testing.

### Q9. Gradual Rollout Strategy
Your service must deploy new versions gradually (10% â†’ 25% â†’ 50% â†’ 100%) to minimize risk. Which Cloud Run feature do you use?  
A. Manual traffic splitting  
B. Auto-scaling policies  
C. Cloud Run Jobs  
D. Cloud Scheduler  
âœ… **Correct Answer: A**  
ðŸ‘‰ Cloud Run has no built-in canary automation â€” you implement rollout manually by updating traffic percentages step by step.

### Q10. Rollback
You deployed a new revision that is failing. Whatâ€™s the fastest rollback method?  
A. Delete the new revision  
B. Use gcloud run services update-traffic to shift 100% back to the previous revision  
C. Redeploy the old Docker image  
D. Use tags to reroute production traffic  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**  
ðŸ‘‰ Rollback = reassign traffic instantly, without deleting revisions. Very fast compared to redeploy.

### Q11. Revision URLs vs Service URLs
Which statement is true about Cloud Run revision URLs?  
A. Revision URLs are permanent and tied to a specific revision  
B. Service URL always points to the latest traffic-splitting config  
C. Tag URLs always point to the tagged revision, regardless of traffic split  
D. All of the above  
âœ… **Correct Answer: D**  
ðŸ‘‰ Revision URL = fixed, per revision. Service URL = obeys traffic split. Tag URL = fixed alias to revision.

### Q12. Blue-Green Deployment
You want 0 downtime when switching traffic between old and new revisions. Which approach is correct?  
A. Deploy new revision, assign tag "green", test, then shift 100% traffic  
B. Delete old revision before deploying new one  
C. Use Cloud Run Jobs  
D. Use Cloud Scheduler to route traffic  
âœ… **Correct Answer: A**  
ðŸ‘‰ Classic blue-green = run both in parallel â†’ test new (via tag) â†’ switch all traffic in one step. Cloud Run fully supports this.

### Q13. Multiple Environments with Tags
You have staging, canary, and production environments in one service. How do you expose them?  
A. Deploy separate services per environment  
B. Use tags (e.g., staging---service.run.app, canary---service.run.app)  
C. Create a VPC for each environment  
D. Use Cloud Run Jobs  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**  
ðŸ‘‰ Tags allow environment-like separation within the same service. Separate services (A) is also valid in real life, but exam emphasizes tags.

### Q14. Cloud Run Definition
What is Cloud Run?  
A. Managed container service with cluster management  
B. Serverless platform for event-driven functions only  
C. Fully managed platform running containers or functions with minimal infra work  
D. Requires cluster setup and Kubernetes  
âœ… **Correct Answer: C**  
ðŸ‘‰ Cloud Run lets you run containers (or functions) without managing clusters.

### Q15. Execution Environments
Which statement is true about Cloud Run execution environments?

B. Services default to auto-select; jobs are always second-gen  
C. Both services and jobs can opt between first and second-gen  
D. All workloads must run on first-gen only  
âœ… **Correct Answer: B**
